Idea:
    Percy Mercy, the fly with no mercy (often called the Redundant fly cause of the name and they would do redundant things)

Characters:

Idea:
    P.O.V. of a weeping angel, from standing there to displacing people through time.

Final decision on the two ideas:
    Will do the fly, maybe do a smaller version game for the weeping angel in the future...

Backstory for the fly:
    Name=Percy Mercy
    Age=Its a fly
    Gender=Radioactive.

    story= Percy Mercy (called Pim for short) was an ordinary house fly that would fly around getting all up in people's faces. One day while flying around, Pim accidently landed on something radioactive and became radioactive himself. He now can fly slightly faster than before, has skin as strong as steel, I mean he's basically a living bullet. Now, with his new abilities, he flies around being the tiniest jerk alive (at the moment).

Must be at least 10 scenarioes!!!

House, food, humans, animals, objects...(elements for the story)

Scenario #1
    You fly around a home and a human is in the proccess of yawning. Do you {A. Fly into their mouth, knowing you have a 50/50 chance of survival? or B. Land on their nose while their eyes are closed?}
    (if you chose A:[
        You zoom into the person's mouth, buzzing around in the dark cave. Its all wet and smells bad, ideal for you to live in if you wanted to. As your floating around in the mouth, the person finishes yawning and closes their mouth. Only a few seconds after closing their mouth do they realize what has happened and immedeatly open it back up and start coughing and wheezing. You take this chance to escape! That was fun!
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You decide to land on their nose while their eyes are closed. What you didn't know was that they had a fly swatter in their hands, but that didnt stop you. They took the fly swatter and tried to get you, but you are to fast and quick on your feet, so instead of getting you, they end up hitting themselves in the face, leaving a red mark especially around the nose.
    ])

Scenario #2
    You continue flying around, laughing about your previous adventure with that human, the look on their face after what you had done. You wernt really paying attention to where you were going and got sucked into a vaccum cleaner. You are now stuck inside the vaccum, trying to think of what to do next. You have 2 choices. You can- {A. Wait until the vaccum gets emptied and then escape. or B. fly into the mechanics and break the vaccum down.}
    {if you chose A:[
        You wait for the vaccum to finish and eventually turn off. Once it does turn off, you make for the exit and fly away from the machine. Thank goodness you didnt try anything drastic, who knows how that would have ended...
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You go to the inner mechanics of the vaccum and clog it up with debris that was stuck to your legs. The whole vaccum starts making bad noises and it stops. You take this chance to escape the vaccum cleaner and fly away.

Scenario #3
    You decide to leave the house and go out to explore the town.

Scenario #4
    .

Scenario #5
    .

Scenario #6
    You're now in a building that has lots of people in dress clothes. Theres a stage with someone on it that looks nervous, like they are about to give a big speech. They have a microphone sitting in a microphone stand. You suddenly have an idea. Do you {A. Go through with the idea? or B. Ignore the idea knowing you could be killed and continue exploring the building?}
    (if you chose A:[
        You decide to go through with your idea. First you sneak over to the mic, making sure its plugged in (which it is of course). Then you land on the microphone and make the most annoying buzzing noises ever as loud as you can. The whole room is in an uproar as they think the noise is caused by someone in the back messing with the sound systems. You just sit there laughing while buzzing until someone sees you on the mic and then- SPLAT! You have been squished! But on the plus side, the person that smushed you didn't know that you were radioactive so now they have radiation poisoning. Poor them. POOR YOU! Oh well, thats life. THE END!
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You continue on with your adventure, exploring the building.
    ])

Scenario #7
    .

Scenario #8
    You are flying around the town and you see a lab-like structure on a hill by itself. Curiousity sets in and you contemplate whether or not you should explore it or just keep flying around the town. Do you- {A. Go and explore the Lab? or B. Keep exploring the town?}
    (if you chose A:[
        You decided to go and explore the lab, curious as to what might lie inside the halls of the sterile building.
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You start to lose interest in the building on the hill and continue exploring the town, but later on you keep thinking about the building on the hill, what secrets it might hold. Eventually, you decide to go back and take a look around the lab, curiousity outrulling reason.
    ])

Scenario #9
    You are flying around a laboratory and you spot a strange device on the table. Normally when you see devices like this, you ignore them but this one is tiny, small enough for you to operate. You look at what different controls it has and there are 2 buttons. One is blue with a circle shape. The other is yellow with a square shape. On the back of the device is a warning not to use or there will be severe consequences. Being the tiny jerk you are, you ignore the warning and decide to use the device just to be funny. Which button do you press?
    Do you press {A. The blue circle button? or B. The yellow square button?}
    (if you chose A:[
        At first, nothing happens. But then you hear a strange noise and suddenly there is a massive black hole forming in the room out of thin air. It swallows the entire earth and everything and everyone dies. THE END!
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You push the yellow button and suddenly it starts raining inside the lab. Apparently you didnt notice you were sitting under a shower head that has been attached to the ceiling. The liquid is a sort of yellow color. Its lemonade! YUM! While you sit there enjoying the lemonade, you wonder who made this device and why. You are happy with the lemonade but now you go to explore the rest of the lab.
    ])

Scenario #10
    You are now in a different part of the lab, exploring and kind of wondering where all the lab people are cause you havent seen any lately. You stumble into a large warehouse-like room that has a huge rocket ship. Your curiousity compels you! You go inside the rocket and see a control panel with all sorts of buttons and switches. Do you {A. Press all the buttons and switches until something happens? or B. Only press one random button?}
    (if you chose A:[
        You press all the buttons and switches to see what happens and for fun because why not? Lots of lights start flashing and noises go off, including what sounds like the engines starting up. Suddenly the rocket blasts right through the roof of the lab and starts heading up into the sky, breaking through the atmosphere. You look out the window and see that you are headed towards the moon! What will you do now? Will you be the first radioactive fly on the moon!?
    ]
    if you chose B:[
        You decided to only press one button and choose a random one. Suddenly a countdown starts and the you hear the sound of the engines of the rocket turning on. You know what that means... THE ROCKET IS GETTING READY TO LAUNCH!!! You and the rocket soon start making your way up, push through the earth's atmosphere, heading for the moon! What will happen now?

        alert('A light breeze blows over you and you start rolling down the long hill. The bird takes notice and flies after you. Once it catches up to you, it then swoops down and grabs you, carrying you off into the sunset, never to be seen again. Such a shame, you were a nice rock too.');
        console.log('answer 2/2', 'If you keep getting this answer, let me know about it because it could be a bug.');
