Idea:
    Percy Mercy, the fly with no mercy (often called the Redundant fly cause of the name and they would do redundant things)

Idea:
    P.O.V. of a weeping angel, from standing there to displacing people through time.

Final decision on the two ideas:
    Will do the fly, maybe do a smaller version game for the weeping angel in the future...

Backstory for the fly:
    Name=Percy Mercy
    Age=Its a fly
    Gender=Radioactive.

    story= Percy Mercy (called Pim for short) was an ordinary house fly that would fly around getting all up in people's faces. One day while flying around, Pim accidently landed on something radioactive and became radioactive himself. He now can fly slightly faster than before, has skin as strong as steel, I mean he's basically a living bullet. Now, with his new abilities, he flies around being the tiniest jerk alive (at the moment).

Must be at least 10 scenarioes!!!

House, food, humans, animals, objects...(elements for the story)

Scenario #1
    You fly around a home and a human is in the proccess of yawning. Do you {A. Fly into their mouth, knowing you have a 50/50 chance of survival? or B. Land on their nose while their eyes are closed?}
    (if you chose A:[
        You zoom into the person's mouth, buzzing around in the dark cave. Its all wet and smells bad, ideal for you to live in if you wanted to. As your floating around in the mouth, the person finishes yawning and closes their mouth. Only a few seconds after closing their mouth do they realize what has happened and immedeatly open it back up and start coughing and wheezing. You take this chance to escape! That was fun!

    ans1 = prompt('Do you: {A. Do nothing} or {B. Run/Roll away}?')

        'a',
        'A'
    ]) {
        // display S1a1
        alert('The bird sees you as just another ordinary rock (cause birds arent always all that bright) and leaves you alone.');
        console.log('answer 1/2');
    } else {
        // display S1a2
        alert('A light breeze blows over you and you start rolling down the long hill. The bird takes notice and flies after you. Once it catches up to you, it then swoops down and grabs you, carrying you off into the sunset, never to be seen again. Such a shame, you were a nice rock too.');
        console.log('answer 2/2', 'If you keep getting this answer, let me know about it because it could be a bug.');
    }
    // } else {
    //     // display concern
    //     alert('You know, I put a lot of hard work into this game, the least you could do is answer correctly!');
    //     console.log('be an jerk');
    // }
