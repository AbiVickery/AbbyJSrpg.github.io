Idea:
    Percy Mercy, the fly with no mercy (often called the Redundant fly cause of the name and they would do redundant things)

Idea:
    P.O.V. of a weeping angel, from standing there to displacing people through time.

Final decision on the two ideas:
    Will do the fly, maybe do a smaller version game for the weeping angel in the future...

Backstory for the fly:
    Name=Percy Mercy
    Age=Its a fly
    Gender=Radioactive.

    story= Percy Mercy (called Pim for short) was an ordinary house fly that would fly around getting all up in people's faces. One day while flying around, Pim accidently landed on something radioactive and became radioactive himself. He now can fly slightly faster than before, has skin as strong as steel, I mean he's basically a living bullet. Now, with his new abilities, he flies around being the tiniest jerk alive (at the moment).
